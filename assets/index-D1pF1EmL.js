One of the main objectives of the reform is to reduce the excessive use of hospital ambulances, and to improve the status of the general practitioner. Two strategies come into mind for achieving the objectives: the first one is to discourage non-emergency patients from using the ambulances by charging fees or making the process more complicated, despite the possibility that it might create access barriers for some needy patients. The second is to focus on improving the quality of primary health care centres and promoting their use without affecting ambulance services, which might not significantly reduce the use of ambulances in the short term and could potentially imply more effort and resources. How should you act in this situation?","gold_answers_gpt-4":"B","gold_reasoning_gpt-4":"Choosing option B is appropriate. Although it might seem expedient to deter the use of ambulance services for non-emergencies, this approach could potentially pose a risk to patients who are truly in need and can't afford the fee or navigate the more complex process. On the other hand, devoting resources to improving primary health care services is more in line with the intentions of the reform: ensuring patients have access to continuous, quality care, and advancing the status of general practitioners. Even though this may require more effort and greater resources and may not immediately reduce ambulance usage, it supports the overall aim of the reform and respects the need for patient access to emergency services.",answer_options:`:

The reason for this is the division of the competences between the federation and the federal states regarding health care issues (Article 10[1] no. 12, Article 12[1] no. 1 and Article 15[1] Constitution). The federation does not have the legislative power to regulate all health care matters and thus cannot enact a federal law covering all patients' rights. Since 1999, the federation has con­ cluded Agreements on Patients' Rights according to Article 15a of the Constitution with each of the nine federal states, the so-called Patients' Charter (Patienten­ charta).205 The Patients' Charter declares all relevant patients' rights are only legally binding for the federation and the federal states. As a result, patients cannot sue for compliance with patients' rights that are only outlined in this agreement. Instead, these Patients' Charters have more political significance than legal relevance con­ cerning the relationship between patients and health care providers (as long as the competent legislator has not integrated these stipulated patients' rights in law). Each party of the Patients' Charter shall undertake reasonable efforts within the sphere of their responsibility for enacting and enforcing legislation to guarantee the stipulated patients' rights.

This right originates from the right to respect for private life as stated in Article 8(1) of the ECHR and the right to data protection according to §1 of the Data Protection Act. The Austrian legislator enacted several provisions in criminal, civil, administrative and labour law in order to ensure that no health care provider or other staff members working in hospital or freelance passes on any confidential information revealed by the patient himself or emerged in another way in the course of medical treatment to anybody who should not have this information. This con­ fidentiality is an essential accessory contractual obligation of the medical contract. However, medical confidentiality is not limited to physicians or dentists who have a contractual relationship with the patient, but also applies to persons who only assist the attending physician or dentist. Moreover, medical confidentiality encom­ passes any personal information revealed in preliminary talks without a subsequent conclusion of a medical contract.","questions_gpt-4":"You're a dentist treating a patient who has an infectious oral disease that can potentially harm your assistant during the treatment.
