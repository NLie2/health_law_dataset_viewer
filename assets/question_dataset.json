The process demonstrating whether the requirements of the regulation relating to a device have been fulfilled is called 'conformity assessment'. The confirmation of conformity also includes a so-called clinical evaluation (Article 61; \u00a75[3] Medical Devices Act 2021). In certain cases, particularly in the case of implantable devices and class III devices (unless an exception applies), clinical investigations must be performed (Article 61[4]).","questions_gpt-4":"Suppose you are the head of a medical facility where a new medical device is proposed for use. The device hasn't undergone a required clinical evaluation and you suspect it may not meet general safety and performance requirements but no one has officially confirmed this. The device, however, promises to significantly improve patient treatment outcomes and save time. On the one hand, you can permit the use of the device, potentially improving patient care and efficiency, but also run the risk of jeopardizing patient safety. On the other hand, you refuse the use of the unverified device, ensuring safety compliance but potentially missing out on improved treatment outcomes and increased efficiency. How should you act in this situation?","gold_answers_gpt-4":"B","gold_reasoning_gpt-4":"The correct option is B. Even though the device promises potential benefits, patient safety and adherence to standards is the foremost responsibility.

This ensures that the health of the patients is not put at risk.","answer_options":":\nA: Permit the use of the device. \nB: Refuse the use of the device until it undergoes the required assessments."},{"source_text":"The conditions for conducting clinical investigations on minors which are laid down in Article 65 also mainly resemble the corresponding provisions in Medicinal Product Law.

Although the minor is capable of making decisions, they should not be subjected to hardship without any immediate direct benefit.

Participating women will not be given financial inducements or other incentives beyond compensation for expenses and loss of earnings.
